# HumusAI
AI calling assistant for deaf and HoH people created in START Hack, St Gallen, Switzerland 2019. Using Microsoft Azure APIs

## Wanna know how it works?
Check video: HumusAI-Product-Video.mp4

## Inspiration
It is predicted that by 2050, 1/10 people are going to have serious hearing problems. Even though we more and more online,
60% of the businesses in the US require a phone call to make an appointment for something simple such as a dentist or hairdresser.

## What it does
We combined AI technologies such as Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech and Natural Langage Processing in one mobile application 
that enables deaf people to make and receive phone calls like anybody else.

## How we built it
The application is built on Android, with the help of Microsoft Azure. 
As we believe that the design is very important when it comes to accessibility, we carefully designed each interaction in Adobe XD.

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up a project, in the beginning, is not easy. Android and Firebase can be very challenging when you work in a team in such a short time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Really good user experience described clearly in the video.
Real-time chat application in Android, that has implemented Speech-to-Text, sign in options and message persistence.

## What we learned
That technology for good can be applied everywhere! 
And from a technical point of view: Microsoft Azure, Android, Firebase, Adobe XD and how to pitch ;)

## What's next for Call4All
For now, we have a prototype, the next is an MVP.
Implement suggestions for answering, try to beat
